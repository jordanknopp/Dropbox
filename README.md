Dropbox
=======

Web application allowing users to play media files directly in file browser of Dropbox.  Also reports metadata about account (%space by filetype, etc)

A demo of the web application can be found at: http://mantispro.com/dropbox/MusicalReportingBox/index.html
I will note that in order to see it, you must provide the applicatoin access to your Dropbox account.
For the security conscious, I've included a "screenshots" folder with a few screenshots to give you an idea of the look and feel of the web application without having to provide it with account permission.

I developed the front end of this project:
- HTML index file
- CSS theme
- Icons

Also included:
- A PDF of the final report we created
- A PDF of the final presentation







This was a project for a Software Development course.  Team members: 
Jordan Knopp (me), Stephen Yoss, Jeff Korn, Yassine Elouri
